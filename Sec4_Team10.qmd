## Research Topic:

#### Which gender-race combinations show the highest vulnerability to either suicide or drug overdose as a cause of death?

This research question aims to investigate how different demographic groups, defined by both gender and race, are disproportionately affected by two significant public health crises: suicides and drug overdoses.

# Data Provenance Description

The data for this research was sourced from Data.gov, the U.S. government's open data platform that provides access to a wide range of datasets collected by federal agencies. Specifically, the datasets on drug overdose death rates and suicide death rates were compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These datasets were created to track trends in mortality rates across different demographic groups and to inform public health strategies. The purpose of using these datasets is to address the research question: Which gender-race combinations show the highest vulnerability to either suicide or drug overdose as a cause of death? The data includes death rates per 100,000 residents, categorized by gender, race, age group, and year, offering a detailed demographic breakdown. This information provides the foundation for analyzing disparities and identifying groups that may be disproportionately affected.
